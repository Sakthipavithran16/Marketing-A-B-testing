# Marketing-A-B-testing

## Introduction
Marketing companies want to run successful campaigns, but the market is complex and several options can work. So normally they tun A/B tests, that is a randomized experimentation process wherein two or more versions of a variable (web page, page element, banner, etc.) are shown to different segments of people at the same time to determine which version leaves the maximum impact and drive business metrics.

## Problem Statement
The companies are interested in answering two questions:
1. Would the campaign be successful?
2. If the campaign was successful, how much of that success could be attributed to the ads?

## Approach

### Data Extraction
Download Dataset: Obtain the Marketing A/B Testing dataset from Kaggle using the appropriate API or direct download.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. Handle Missing Values: Identify and address missing values using techniques like imputation or removal.
2. Remove Duplicates: Eliminate any duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
3. Data Type Conversion: Convert data types to appropriate formats (e.g., date, numeric) for analysis.
4. Data Validation: Verify data consistency and accuracy, including checking for outliers and anomalies.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Statistical Summary: Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.) to understand data distribution.
2. Data Visualization: Create visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc.) to identify trends, patterns, and outliers

### Data Analysis and Insights
Perform Univariate analysis and Bivariate analysis with respect to Conversion data.

### Data Visualization
Data Visualization Tools: Utilize tools like Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to create visualizations.

### Hypothesis Testing
Perform statistical tests like the chi-square test to validate findings and strengthen conclusions.
